# 🪄 Sorting Hat Quiz — Form Practice Project

A humorous, lightly unhinged Hogwarts House sorting quiz built as a follow-up to my HTML course project.
This quiz was created to practice HTML forms, radio inputs, and JavaScript form handling beyond the basics — with plans to expand into multiple quizzes and a proper index page in the future.

## 📖 About the Project

This quiz is part of my ongoing journey to better understand how forms work in the browser.
The goal was to create:

- A multi-question form using radio inputs

- A system for reading answers with JavaScript (I will update it to more sturdy one in the future. For now I just wanted basic functionality)

- Score tracking for multiple outcomes (the Hogwarts Houses)

- A playful, personality-based quiz that reacts to user choices

- Input validation (sorting requires at least one answer for now)

The spirit of the quiz is chaotic, witty, and full of character — mirroring the tone I enjoy bringing into my projects.

## ✨ Features

### ✔️ Ten Themed Questions

Each question offers four choices mapped to the four Houses.
The topics range from reactions, personal quirks, and moral alignment… to dangerous academic decisions.

### ✔️ House Score Tracking

The script:

- Reads which radio button is checked for each question

- Increments the matching House score

- Detects ties by choosing the first House with the highest score

- Outputs a final judgment from the Sorting Hat

### ✔️ Form Validation

If the user selects zero answers, the quiz gently 🧙‍♂️ yells at them:

“You belong to NOWHERE — answer at least one question!”

### ✔️ Expandable Structure

The project is structured so more quizzes, pages, or categories can be added later.

Future updates will include:

- A proper landing/index page

- Additional themed quizzes

- Maybe even a localStorage profile page
